I would like to add a badge that counts the total number of downloads that happen for one of my projects that I have on GitHub. I came across this page that has all the image shields


![Github Releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/atom/atom/latest/total.svg?style=plastic)

Any ideas on how I could add this to my project in GitHub?

You have to insert it as an image into your README. If your README is markdown (README.md) that should be like:

Syntax:

[![Github All Releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/fireflasher21/fabric-rplog/total.svg)]()
This Mod is a simple Log Plugin, which logs Keywords which you can specify beforehanded and mid Playing. 
It saves it logs in sorted Folders per Server and you can add custom Keyword Lists for each Server
If none Custom Server List is given, the Mod uses the Default List which can also be edited independtly
At the Moment it can only be Configured with Modmenu from Terraformers: https://github.com/TerraformersMC/ModMenu

A Forge equivalent exists too, check out here: https://github.com/Fireflasher21/Forge-RPLog
All Major Version Steps are syncronised so you dont get confused.

If you experience any Crashes or Bugs open an Issue. Im also always happy to improve the mod, so send me ideas of what you think would be neat to add.

History:
This Mod was written by me to help specifically Roleplayers, which often access the logs of their RP History if their Server is text based. 
In my Case it was Aegorin and all the people who make this Server what it is. To help them and to increase the fun and Quality of the Roleplay i started this Mod 

If you want to check out the Server here you go: https://Aegorin.de
But keep in mind, that the Servers only language is German
